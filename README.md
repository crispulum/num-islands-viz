## Num-Islands: Classic Problem

### Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the classic computer science problem: **Num-Islands**. The problem involves determining the number of islands formed by '1's in a 2D grid of '0's and '1's, where islands are defined as contiguous regions of '1's. This implementation offers a solution to this intriguing problem in JavaScript.

### Getting Started

To run the code:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
Algorithm

For details on the algorithm used to solve the Num-Islands problem, refer to the num-islands.js file in the repository. The implementation and approach are explained within the code comments.
Num-Islands Problem

In the Num-Islands problem, the task is to count the number of islands in a given grid. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. Grid cells are either land ('1') or water ('0'), and islands are formed by groups of adjacent lands.
